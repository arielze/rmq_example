===========
This is ‘vanilla’ example of the use of Sneakers, 
it is very basic, it includes the worker which uses [Sneakers](https://github.com/jondot/sneakers) as [Rabbit](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) consumer and [Newrelic](http://newrelic.com/) for reporting and monitoring.

later on I’ll add:

1. message publishing to rabbit
2. start and stop scripts
3. deployment script (capistrano)
